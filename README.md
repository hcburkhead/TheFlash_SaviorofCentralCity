# TheFlash_SaviorofCentralCity
Fan made game of the Flash in his craziest adventure yet...

Please download the project from the release folder when I upload it. This is not a full-fledged game as I am not a game developer studio, just an indie hobbyist. The Flash:Savior of Central City is a 3D platformer with a sandbox environment for players to run around in at high speeds with arkam-style combat.
